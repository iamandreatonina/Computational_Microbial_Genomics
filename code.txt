# Annotations:
  --kingdom [X]     Annotation mode: Archaea|Bacteria|Mitochondria|Viruses (default 'Bacteria')

All the MAGs have been annotated, for each we created several outputs files:
(1) .fna file -> complete nucleotide FASTA file
(2) .faa file -> protein FASTA file -> contains the amminoacids of the encoded proteins -> We have multiples protein ID because from the genome we can translate more than one protein -> ID of the proteins
(3) .tsv file -> table summary -> tab-separated file of all the features of protein_loci -> with a description
(4) .txt file -> summary containing statistics relating to the annotated features found such as the number of contigs, the number of CDS, the number of rRNA and tRNA and the number of bases.
(5) .gbk file -> standard genome bank file -> we have more info like db_xref (=linking DNA sequence records to other external databases), etc
(6) .gff -> contains both the sequences and the annotations. It can be viewed directly in Artemis or IGV.

How many CDS were found in one of your MAGs?
cat ${sample_name}.txt
To look at all the values in all the files -> grep -w 'CDS' */*.txt -> minimum value of CDS is 2651
CDS: protein coding sequence (CDS) region of each gene. CDS is a sequence of nucleotides that corresponds with the sequence of amino acids in a protein

How many hypothetical proteins?
grep –c hypothetical */*.tsv -> to look at the value for all the different MAGs we have -> minimal value: 1190


How many known proteins?
grep –c –v hypothetical ${sample_name}.tsv
# Annotation: -v, --invert-match -> select non-matching lines -> so here we select the known proteins -> these proteins, since are known are memorized in the data with thei name

-> to look at the total numbers of proteins from a .tsv file, both known and unknown we need the following command: grep -c 'CDS' */*.tsv
